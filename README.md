# Flutter : Login/Sign Up UI Designs.


You guys have might heard about Flutter.
Flutter is an app SDK for building high-performance, high-fidelity apps for iOS, Android, web (beta), and desktop (technical preview) from a single codebase. The goal is to enable developers to deliver high-performance apps that feel natural on different platforms.
We all know Flutter is gaining huge appreciation throughout the world because of its beautiful and flexible User Interface. It focuses on native end-user experiences. Layered architecture allows for full customization, which results in incredibly fast rendering, expressive and flexible designs.
 The idea of implementing Login/Sign up designs in Flutter came to me in flash of inspiration from some Pinterest and Dribble designs.
Let's Begin:

While I was implementing this design i came through a very helpful Dart package "Flutter Custom Clippers" which helps to clip container in various different shapes.

The following designs are implemented using Stack Widget. I referred this medium page named "Exploring Stack and IndexedStack in Flutter" by Deven Joshi. This article walks you through Stack and how to position the widgets on to Stack.
